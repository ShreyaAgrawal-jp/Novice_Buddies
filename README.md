This is Our first ever Hackathon idea implementation and we call it MAT-HUB.

During this pandemic situation, due to lackdowns and curfews, it has become difficult for students to arrange books and other things like components for their projects.

Our idea is to build a web application that helps students find study material and other education related stuff near them (with in the range of 1 Km).
